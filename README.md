Telecom Account Management - README
This project is a MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application for a telecom service provider. It enables customers to manage their accounts, view billing statements, make payments, update personal information, track data usage, and request support — all in one platform.

Project Overview
This application addresses the following main objectives:

Account Management: Secure login, account overviews, personal info edits.
Billing & Payments: Billing statements, transaction history, and multiple payment methods.
Data Usage: Real-time and historical usage tracking.
Support: Ticket-based customer support and an FAQ chatbot.
Notifications: In-app alerts for account events (payments, plan changes, etc.).
It covers 16 functional requirements (FR-1 to FR-16) such as user registration, plan management, notifications, and support ticketing.

Microservices & Modules
To keep development modular and maintainable, the system is divided into five main modules (microservices):

Authentication & Settings
Personal Information & Account Overview
Support & Chatbot
Data Usage & Plan Management
Payment & Transactions
Each module can be developed as a separate Node.js service (or combined as needed) and then integrated via REST APIs.

API Endpoints
Below is an overview of the main endpoints within each module. In a real-world project, you’d likely add request/response examples, error codes, and authentication/authorization details.

1. Authentication & Settings
Endpoint	HTTP	Description
/auth/register	POST	Registers a new user (mobile/email, name, password, security question, etc.).
/auth/login	POST	Authenticates user (or admin) and returns a session token/JWT.
/auth/logout	POST	Invalidates the current session token.
/auth/forgot-password	POST	Initiates password reset (verify mobile / security question).
/auth/reset-password	POST	Resets the password after verification.
/settings	GET	Retrieves user’s account settings (notification preferences, theme, etc.).
/settings	PUT	Updates user’s account settings (notification prefs, theme, etc.).
/settings/change-password	PATCH	Changes the user’s password (requires old password or a valid session).
/settings/account	DELETE	Deactivates or deletes the user’s own account.
/notifications	GET	Retrieves in-app notifications (filtered by user if user role, or all if admin role).
/notifications/:id/mark-read	PATCH	Marks a specific notification as read.
Role-based Logic:

User can only manage their own settings and see their own notifications.
Admin can manage system-level settings or retrieve notifications for any user if needed.
2. Personal Information & Account Overview
Endpoint	HTTP	Description
/account	GET	Shows account overview (mobile #, status, plan type, etc.).
/account/plan	GET	Displays current plan details (name, validity, remaining data/SMS/talktime).
/account/personal-info	GET	Returns user’s personal info (email, address, alt mobile, etc.).
/account/personal-info	PUT	Updates personal info (address, alt mobile, etc.).
Role-based Logic:

User sees and updates their own account.
Admin may optionally retrieve/modify any user’s account if the application logic permits.
3. Support & Chatbot
Endpoint	HTTP	Description
/support/tickets	GET	Retrieves all support tickets for the logged-in user (or all if admin).
/support/tickets	POST	Creates a new support ticket.
/support/tickets/:ticketId	GET	Fetches details of a specific support ticket.
/support/tickets/:ticketId	PATCH	Updates the ticket (add notes, change status, etc.).
/chatbot/query	POST	Submits a user query to the FAQ chatbot; returns an automated response.
/chatbot/faq (optional)	GET	Retrieves frequently asked questions (static or dynamic).
Role-based Logic:

User can only see and modify their own tickets.
Admin can see and update all tickets (e.g., escalations).
4. Data Usage & Plan Management
Endpoint	HTTP	Description
/usage	GET	Shows current usage stats (data, SMS, voice calls) for the logged-in user.
/usage/history	GET	(Optional) Retrieves historical usage data (daily/monthly breakdown).
/plans	GET	Lists available prepaid and postpaid plans with pricing details.
/plans/:planId	GET	Gets details of a single plan.
/plans/change	POST	Switches the user’s current plan to a new one (prepaid or postpaid).
/plans/top-up	POST	(Prepaid) Adds talktime, data packs, or roaming packs.
/plans/upgrade	PATCH	(Postpaid) Upgrades the user’s plan (more connections, higher data, etc.).
Role-based Logic:

User changes their own plan, sees their own usage.
Admin can manage plan offerings (create/update/delete) or view any user’s usage if permitted in the code logic.
5. Payment & Transactions
Endpoint	HTTP	Description
/billing	GET	Retrieves current billing info (due dates, amounts, billing cycle).
/billing/statements	GET	Lists all past billing statements for the logged-in user.
/billing/statements/:statementId/download	GET	Downloads a specific statement as a PDF.
/transactions	GET	Returns the user’s transaction history (or all if admin).
/transactions/:transactionId	GET	Gets details of a specific transaction.
/transactions	POST	Makes a payment (select credit/debit/UPI), covering FR-8 and FR-9.
/transactions/:transactionId/cancel (optional)	PATCH	Cancels or reverses a pending transaction (if business logic allows).
Role-based Logic:

User can only access their own billing/transactions.
Admin may view or manage all user transactions for auditing/refunds if allowed.

Setup & Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/telecom-account-management.git
Install Dependencies for each microservice (if separated):

bash
Copy
cd auth-settings-service && npm install
cd personal-info-service && npm install
# etc.
Or if it’s a monolithic repository with subfolders, run npm install at the root (depending on your structure).

Environment Variables

Create a .env file in each service or in the root with variables like:
bash
Copy
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/telecomDB
JWT_SECRET=some-secret-key
...
Run Services

Example (for a single microservice approach):
bash
Copy
npm start
Or if multiple services, run each one on a different port.
Verify

Access the endpoints using a tool like Postman or cURL to ensure they respond correctly.
Folder Structure
An example monorepo-like structure:

kotlin
Copy
telecom-account-management/
  ├─ auth-settings/
  │   ├─ controllers/
  │   ├─ models/
  │   ├─ routes/
  │   └─ ...
  ├─ personal-info/
  │   ├─ controllers/

  │   ├─ ...
  ├─ data-usage-plan/
  │   ├─ ...
  ├─ payment-transactions/
  │   ├─ ...
  └─ README.md
Each service could have its own package.json, server file, .env, etc. Adjust as needed.

Notes
For production or larger projects, you might add advanced features (Docker, message queues, admin dashboards, etc.).
Always secure your endpoints with proper authentication/authorization checks.
Maintain documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) for each microservice or a unified API gateway.
